      "why" : "Jennifer Zyman, Atlanta Magazine restaurant critic and former editor of Eater Atlanta, raved about this newly-opened Korean barbecue spot last year. The restaurant uses traditional charcoal table grills rather than electric. The unmistakeable, smokey flavor the grill produces in the meats along with the quality of the meat used make all the difference. Order the Special #2 with seasoned pork, pork belly, beef short ribs, rib eye, beef bulgogi, and brisket. It comes with banchan (Korean side dishes including kimchi fried rice).",
