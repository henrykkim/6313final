      "why" : "Jennifer Zyman, Atlanta Magazine restaurant critic and former editor of Eater Atlanta, raved about this newly-opened Korean barbecue spot last year. The restaurant uses traditional charcoal table grills rather than electric. The unmistakeable, smokey flavor the grill produces in the meats along with the quality of the meat used make all the difference. Order the Special #2 with seasoned pork, pork belly, beef short ribs, rib eye, beef bulgogi, and brisket. It comes with banchan (Korean side dishes including kimchi fried rice).",
      "dish": "Pork belly is the most popular meat for Korean BBQ in South Korea. While it's exactly the same part as bacon, the flavor is so much juicier and texture from its thickness is amazing. My friends who tried pork belly think bacon is overrated now. ",

It’s great for late nights, beer, soju, small bites, and karaoke.

      "dish": "Fishcake can be easily found on the street in South Korea for a quick snack. This, on the other hand, is a fancier version with soup. It is also a perfect food to enjoy with soju, a Korean liquor.",
