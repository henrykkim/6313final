          <p class="pt-3">As a native speaker, I was surprised to learn that Atlanta has the sixth largest Korean community in America, and seeing so many Korean signs in Buford Highway supported the claim. However, when I started looking around to find good Korean restaurants, I have had more failures than success. Then I realized the information I used to get from Yelp or Foursquare was not as great as suggestions from other native speakers. That's when I started collecting my own lists to create this website.</p>
          <p>By clicking the pins on the map, you will see not just curated Korean restaurant information, but description about the iconic food that I love and used to ear when I lived in South Korea. I understand it's hard to try a complete-strange-dish, so I explained ingredients, reasons I love this particular dish, and how spicy it is.</p>
